#Problem 1

Early January Weather describes weather details recorded at `EWR` using the `origin` variable from in `2013` from January `r min(early_january_weather$day)` to `r max(early_january_weather$day)`. Temperature is measured in Fahrenheit with the variable `temp`and values range from `r min(early_january_weather$temp)` to `r max(early_january_weather$temp)`. The variable `wind_speed` ranges from `r min(early_january_weather$wind_speed)` to `r max(early_january_weather$speed)` and humidity ranges from `r min(early_january_weather$humid)` to `r max(early_january_weather$humid)`.

The mean temperature is `r mean(early_january_weather$temp)`.

In this data set, there are `r nrow(early_january_weather)` rows and `r ncol(early_january_weather)` columns.
